# Welcome

Let me introduce myself. I'm a 23-year-old student at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia. I'm currently enrolled in the Master Degree Artificial Intelligence Engineering (AIE) program, Large Scale path.
I like almost all technologies and I really appreciate the world of AI and ML.

## My studies

My approach with the world of tecologies, programming and stuff like that started when I was 14 years old. I started with the basics of programming, learning the C, C++ and Java. During my bechelor degree, I deeply studied the C language during the first year (*Fondamenti di informatica 1* and *Fondamenti di informatica 2*), and then I started to study Java and Python. I also studied the foundamentals of computer architecture, during the course *Calcolatori Elettronici*, and the basics of the operating systems, during the course *Sistemi Operativi*. I also studied the basics of the web development, during the course *Tecnologie Web*.
I also have a good knowledge of the theory and the practice behind the Systems and Networks, thanks to the courses *Reti di Calcolatori*.

## Artificial Intelligence Engineering

In this moment, I'm enrolled in the Master Degree Artificial Intelligence Engineering (AIE) program, Larnge Scale path. 
In this course, I'm studying at a deep level the world of AI and ML
Some of the courses that I'm attending are:
- *Machine Learning and Deep Learning*
- *Computer Vision and Cognitive Systems*
- *Mathematical Methods for Machine Learning*
- *Big Data and Text Analysis*
- *IoT and 3D Intelligent Systems*
- *Multimedia Data Processing*
- *and many others...*



## Blog

In my blog, I will share some articles that will touch on topics strictly related to AI and ML. [Visit the blog](blog).
